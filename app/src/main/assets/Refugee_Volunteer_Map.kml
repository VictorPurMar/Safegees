						<value>A new Balkan route for people from the Middle East seems to be opening.

After a 35-year-old Syrian national illegally crossed CR border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Donji Lapac area last week, on /11 in Vrhovine, in an abandoned train station, 4 Kurds with Turkish citizenship were arrested.

While walking the road between Plitvice and Korenica, they managed to found someone who transported them to Vrhovine, a town halfway between the Plitvice Lakes and Otočac. They wanted to continue to Rijeka and reach the northern Italy through Slovenia, since borders at that area are much softer than at Šentilj border crossing between Slovenia and Austria. But, after 21 days of travel in buses, taxis and on foot, they were arrested in Vrhovine. They will most likely be deported to Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

The new route would mean that Bosnia and Herzegovina would for the first time have to deal with the problem of refugees.

						<value>After the security check and the registration procedure of the people arrived in Dobova on 21/1 at 21:45,15 people from Morocco, Syria and Iraq did not meet the requirements to enter the country. They were issued rejection decisions and ordered detention. They did not express the intention to apply for international protection in Slovenia, Austria or Germany but indicated other countries as their final destinations. The Croatian law enforcement authorities were notified of the rejection on the basis of the Schengen Borders Code while the procedures have not been concluded yet.

Refugees can arrive here by train under Croatian police escort. Having undergone registration procedures and having received medical and humanitarian assistance, they will be taken to accommodation centers inland, under police escort.

People at Dobova 2 only stay for a few hours during which they receive clothes, food and medical attention. 

All refugees board trains directly  going to the AT border (Sentilj/Spielfeld).

Police, ADRA, Caritas RC and Civil Protection onsite 

Dobova is divided into two parts: the main camp and the side one. The side-camp has a capacity of 2000 people.

The nearby Harmica/Rigonce border is closed to regular traffic.

Some SEM volunteers are in Athens helping in Victoria square and they're trying to get a permission to work there although people can help anyway there.

SEM helps refugees in the detention centers and jails of Hungary, besides who already got asylum. They also help Hungarian homeless and they have just started a program for Hungarian teenagers to learn about voluntarism.

SEM is going to start an integration program for refugee ladies who already live in Hungary.

Families and women without men can ask to sleep inside, but there are only 300 spots. Every morning everybody has to leave and hopes to get in again the following night.<br><br>PROCESS: In order to continue traveling and to be able to buy a ticket for the ferry, everybody needs to register. For people from Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Somalia, Oman and Eritrea this process is quite fast as people from these countries are officially considered refugees and just have to show their ID. They usually stay only for a couple of hours in the camp, tops one night. Everybody else, meaning people from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Lebanon and Morocco, has to apply for the refugee status. Upon arrival they get a ticket with a number and a date. Refugees need to obtain a ticket free of charge, which they do at nationality-specific gates. This is the first step. Nothing should come before it. At the moment the wait is about 4 days until it's their turn to stand in line, tell their story and hope to be accepted. The refugee status is the reason for which there are no more bigger tents as the UNHCR is not allowed to help people that are no refugees, yet.<br><br>INSIDE THE CAMP: Moria camp is a detention center with high wall and a 5000 people capacity. It is usually crowded. The main authorities are the police and UNHCR collaborating with Mercy Worldwide. Police take pictures and fingerprints. After registration, they are free to get a ferry to Athens. Refugees are possibly detained/deported if they do not meet qualifications for asylum. There are special dormitories managed by Mercy Worldwide for wet, sick, disabled, lonely women and unaccompanied children but space is limited. Vulnerable cases should not be left outside, but it’s up to the NGO. They will share the place with other families and once they enter they can’t leave and they can’t be joined by others later. They need to enter all at the same time. Food is provided inside. There are showers and power in some of the rooms. There is a doctor onsite 24/7. In most of the rooms, they will have to sleep on the floor, on roll mats; some rooms have beds and mattresses. There are some large UNHCR cabins which can be used by people to sleep in. People are able to put their tents up, some do this inside the camp, others in the olive grove outside. Into the camp there’s a tea tent and the family compound run by independent volunteers.<br><br>OUTSIDE THE CAMP: Many people do not have tents, there is no shelter, no toilets, no showers.<br>Police uses batons on refugees. The queue for registering can be 2 km long. Children sleep in bin bags when it rains. People in the back of the line don’t have access to water and they sleep outside. There are usually two regular food distributions a day, one at 15:00 in the area near to the main entrance, the other around 19:00 in the area near the other entrance. Other distributions does take place close to the second gate with no regular set times. There are water points in the camp. The water is drinkable. MSF tent is on the right hand side, after the area where the Syrian registration takes place. This is open 17:00- 00:00. There are other doctors onsite from various other NGOs. There are UNHCR and so-called IKEA tents with no floor and not all people can fit.<br><br>OUTSIDE THE CAMP-AFGHAN HILL: Better days for Moria volunteers are running the so-called Afghan hill. <br><br>O Allos Anthropos, No Borders Kitchen and WeActSweden group cook here.<br><br>Facebook Groups: https://m.facebook.com/WEACTsweden/<br><br>https://www.facebook.com/Better-days-for-moria-1025571667507571/?ref=all_category_pyml<br><br>https://www.facebook.com/koinonikikouzinamjt<br><br>https://www.facebook.com/sistersinhealth/?fref=ts<br><br>Coordinators: Better days for Moria coordinator is Kiki  +306951372507<br><br>Breakfast Club: Lisa Van Nievelt abagtothefuture@gmail.com or +31650612211<br>Supply needs: Baby milk, back packs<br><br>quality, warmer coats for men, women, children.

Stands onsite where to buy supplies. 

CAMP: The camp is set up around an old military base and run by prison guards. Families and women without men can ask to sleep inside, but there are only 300 spots. Every morning everybody has to leave and hopes to get in again the following night.

PROCESS: In order to continue traveling and to be able to buy a ticket for the ferry, everybody needs to register. For people from Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Somalia, Oman and Eritrea this process is quite fast as people from these countries are officially considered refugees and just have to show their ID. They usually stay only for a couple of hours in the camp, tops one night. Everybody else, meaning people from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Lebanon and Morocco, has to apply for the refugee status. Upon arrival they get a ticket with a number and a date. Refugees need to obtain a ticket free of charge, which they do at nationality-specific gates. This is the first step. Nothing should come before it. At the moment the wait is about 4 days until it's their turn to stand in line, tell their story and hope to be accepted. The refugee status is the reason for which there are no more bigger tents as the UNHCR is not allowed to help people that are no refugees, yet.

INSIDE THE CAMP: Moria camp is a detention center with high wall and a 5000 people capacity. It is usually crowded. The main authorities are the police and UNHCR collaborating with Mercy Worldwide. Police take pictures and fingerprints. After registration, they are free to get a ferry to Athens. Refugees are possibly detained/deported if they do not meet qualifications for asylum. There are special dormitories managed by Mercy Worldwide for wet, sick, disabled, lonely women and unaccompanied children but space is limited. Vulnerable cases should not be left outside, but it’s up to the NGO. They will share the place with other families and once they enter they can’t leave and they can’t be joined by others later. They need to enter all at the same time. Food is provided inside. There are showers and power in some of the rooms. There is a doctor onsite 24/7. In most of the rooms, they will have to sleep on the floor, on roll mats; some rooms have beds and mattresses. There are some large UNHCR cabins which can be used by people to sleep in. People are able to put their tents up, some do this inside the camp, others in the olive grove outside. Into the camp there’s a tea tent and the family compound run by independent volunteers.

OUTSIDE THE CAMP: Many people do not have tents, there is no shelter, no toilets, no showers.
Police uses batons on refugees. The queue for registering can be 2 km long. Children sleep in bin bags when it rains. People in the back of the line don’t have access to water and they sleep outside. There are usually two regular food distributions a day, one at 15:00 in the area near to the main entrance, the other around 19:00 in the area near the other entrance. Other distributions does take place close to the second gate with no regular set times. There are water points in the camp. The water is drinkable. MSF tent is on the right hand side, after the area where the Syrian registration takes place. This is open 17:00- 00:00. There are other doctors onsite from various other NGOs. There are UNHCR and so-called IKEA tents with no floor and not all people can fit.

OUTSIDE THE CAMP-AFGHAN HILL: Better days for Moria volunteers are running the so-called Afghan hill.

Refugees get here from Kare Tepe refugee camp and Moria refugee camp after registration with police. Registration includes fingerprints and they got handed out papers, that allow them to buy tickets for the ferries. It depends on the nationality how long these papers are valid. For refugees from Syria there are valid for 6 months, but for all other nationalities they are valid only for one month. It is important, that the refugees keep their registration papers, because they will need them also after taking the ferry. 
Into the registration centers there also are photocopiers available to make copies of papers in case of damage or loss.

 Independent volunteers and NGOs as Oxfam hand out food in the harbor. O Allos Anthropos is cooking together with the NoBorderKitchen here by providing food 2-3 times a day. MSF has a camper van and provides medical support from 9 to 14:00.

Refugees are permitted to stay in hotels in Mytilene with proof of registration/police note.

There are always people camping in the harbour waiting to get a ferry. The number of them depends on the number of people, that come from the camps, the number of the ferries and if they can afford the ticket prices. 

Tickets for a ferry to Athens can be purchased at the Port through travel agencies or from the ticket booth in Kara Tepe. Tickets can also be purchased online with a credit card. 
Ferries travel every day from Mytilene to Athens. Ferry journey vary from company to company. It can take between 8.50 to 12 hours.  Prices vary between 45.50 and 75 euro depends on adult/children, meals and seat's type. Some journeys can include a 12 hours stop in Chios.

				<description><![CDATA[Updated at: 22/1 23:00 CET<br>Nr. of refugees: 100 weekly<br>Situation: 29/12 Sweden has decided to employ border control on all transportation going there to make sure that everyone coming to Sweden have shown their identification. There will be a control-point in Copenhagen Airport, where all travelers to Sweden will be checked. They have constructed a fence in the airport where people will be divided into three different lines: Non-EU-citizens, EU-citizens and ‘common travelers’. Every non-EU-citizen will have a picture taken of their identification, that the Danish train travel company DSB will send to Sweden to document that they are upholding the control. People on a train from Germany on their way to Sweden, have to stop at Copenhagen Central station and take a train to the airport. Here they will go to the track with trains for Sweden where the control points are. Everybody boarding the trains to Sweden will have to go through the control. If they have identification and they want to seek asylum in Sweden, that is still possible. People without identification will not be detained, but will have to either seek asylum in Denmark or return to Germany.<br><br>The Migration Board can no longer provide shelter for all asylum seekers who come to Sweden. This means that applicants can henceforth have to arrange accommodation on their own. Families will be given priority when the accommodation places are allocated to applicants. Housing situation is acute. Today the agency has for the first time come to a point where you register new asylum seekers without simultaneously offering an accommodation.

The Migration Board can no longer provide shelter for all asylum seekers who come to Sweden. This means that applicants can henceforth have to arrange accommodation on their own. Families will be given priority when the accommodation places are allocated to applicants. Housing situation is acute. Today the agency has for the first time come to a point where you register new asylum seekers without simultaneously offering an accommodation. Primarily single men are affected by the change. The Swedish Migration Board are taking further steps to find new accommodation sites by creating more space in existing homes, opening new accommodations and take more municipal evacuation seats. 

Refugees get here from Germany and Denmark.
1. Refugees arrive in Trelleborg from Rostock (DE) by ferry. 3-4 ferries arrive daily. The journey takes 6-8 hours for which they pay 20-30 euro. Waiting time to get a ferry is 4-5 days. 
2. Refugees arrive in Gothenburg from Kiel (DE) by ferry. There's one ferry a day. They pay 90-150 euro and waiting time to get a ferry is 7 days. 
3. Refugees arrive in Trelleborg from Berlin and passing through Sassnitz (DE) by ferry. They pay 11-17 euro.
4. Refugees arrive in Sweden from Flensburg (Denmark) by train.

All asylum seekers in Sweden go to the Migration Center in Malmo. 

On 13/11 12:00 Sweden is going to start a temporary border control due to the high pressure on the migration agency because it doesn't want to take its responsibilities and because of the lack of good structures. No one without ID or passport can enter. Refugees could seek for asylum to Sweden at the border, seek for asylum or stay in Finland or Denmark or try to find another way to reach the country they would like to reach.

Unaccompanied minors onsite.
                                                                    
ALL refugees get free health care without having to register here if they want to go to Norway or Finland. A clinic is helping everyone. See at http://www.skane.se/webbplatser/primarvarden_skane/vardcentraler/vara-vardcentraler/malmo/malmo---sodervarn/

Those who are heading to Norway and Finland choose not to register. Sweden offers asylum to all Syrians. Many Iraqis and Eritreans arrived too. 

Who registers in the Swedish reception centers, stays there for up to a year. The process takes time. Most reception centers have good standards (not tents, etc). Only registered ones as asylum seekers get shelter from the Swedish authorities while their applications are processed.

 Refugees can stay on their own while the application process is going on but they are just helped by local volunteers. Many refugees seek asylum in Stockholm and Gothenburg.

The road between Eftalou and Skala Sikamineas is inaccessible (unsafe) most of the time due to heavy rains and the mud makes it extremely slippery.

Volunteers have cleaned the shore.

Drop in the ocean is keeping watch of the beach 24/7 and also have teamed with Bergen medics to provide medical assistance 24/7.

There is very little support from large aid agencies here—it is almost all small-scale groups and individual volunteers helping people off boats and attending to their immediate needs: medical care, dry clothes, etc.

Efthalou has been reported as a landing spot for boats. In fact, boats can land along the 10 km between Molyvos and Skala Sikimineas. Here they are taken through minivans to Oasis (bus stop) and from here to Oxy where they get shelter.

The Hotel Akti is offering rooms at 10 euro per night for volunteers and, for car rentals, the Kempsons recommend Number 1 Rentals in Petra as they have been very supportive over the past few months with efforts on the island.

						<value>Refugees stay in Sentilj for a few hours. Police count them in Sentilj, as well in Spielfeld.

Slovenian army will be cooking for the refugees from now on, only from 18:00 to 21:00 CET. 

RC is not in service from 15:00.

Spielfeld: Waiting time is reduced thanks to better organisation on the AT side (more lines to enter the country were added and hence less crowd control problems).

Are You Syrious group is the only group that can operate in NML. It is extremely important to respect police instructions and to maximally obey all of the rules volunteers agreed to.

31/10 Refugees entering NML unaware of the long wait in the open, have pushed the AT wire fence, occasionally leading to violent clashes with AT police. Several times volunteers from both sides were allowed to enter there and provide help. 

800 neo-fascists were protesting against the refugees, with a pro-refugee counter protest also going on.

In Sentilj people get rest and continue by bus or taxi toward Vienna for 410 euros total. 

RC Österreich and Slovenska Filantropija onsite in Spielfeld.

The no man's land (NML) is a problem when it's too crowded and AT authorities don't let refugees pass and make them wait outside. It's located between Sentiji and Spielfeld but people wait by entrance to Spielfeld. Anyway, volunteers can easily get here from the SLO side (taking the first small road under the first gas station after crossing the border from AT to SLO).

This is a SLO/AUT exit point, now the main entry point into Austria.

The camp is composed of two parts: uphill and downhill. The entrance camp is uphill and it’s where most of refugees are.

Military forces are mostly based uphill where the registration process takes place. Here’s also food supply tents. No wifi on this part of the camp.

Doctors, Civil Protection and dark tents of clothing supplies are based downhill.

Refugees are not allowed to move between the two parts. Sick people have to ask for a special permission since doctors can’t move.

Plugs to charge phones onsite.

How to get to Sentiji:
Use the highway border crossing to Slovenia, take the first exit after a very short drive, go right and right and stop at the police blockade.

How to get into Spielfeld: Take highway exit 'Spielfeld'. Go left at the round-about. There is a police check point where you will be asked if you are registered before entering. Go straight for approximately 1 km. The transit area is to your left. You will find RC HQ, kitchen and food distribution point at the left near section of the area.

In Obenaus we invite volunteers to come for resting.

						<value>Vrhnika is an accommodation center.

Refugees get usually here by bus from Dobova, but it can happen from other locations as well and then moved by train via Jesenice border crossing with Austria.

Refugees are in an old military structure. In the building there is wi-fi &amp; electricity. No running water in the building, but they are trying to fix it. However there are 3 showers with warm water outside the camp, and a number of faucets with cold, running water. 

Civil Protection is onsite and they are very cooperative. 

People stay there only for about 6 hours and they are being driven by buses to Jesenice border crossing. The overall capacity of the camp is about 1200 people. They get a cold dish but they are working on the future provision of a warm meal as well.

There's no way to know where refugees get here. Independent volunteers who live close to the square go to check from time to time.  Refugees usually arrive at night and take the bus at 8:00 on the morning after towards Idomeni. Only few volunteers onsite. Refugees have not food and supplies. There was just a clown making balloons for kids.

Some refugees who stay in Galatsi and Helliniko refugee camps usually come here to meet their friends and/or the rest of their families. 

There are some political issues for this spot. Athens's mayor doesn't agree with refugees' presence here. However, volunteers are still going to the place and bring supplies to distribute, playing drums and dancing together with refugees. A lot of families with small children are present here. Temperature is cold at night.

Boat Refugee Foundation and SEM on site.

This seems to be the number one meeting place for refugees (mostly Afghans) after they land in Athens. From here some buses come and take them to Helliniko or Galatsi refugee camps. They may also go to the Notara 26 squat but space can be limited. Refugees also go directly to Macedonia. There are direct buses to Idomeni too.

Most days the square is filled with refugees then in the evening/night they get shuttled to a shelter, if lucky. There is no shelter here it's just an open square with trees and some cafes. There were a few individuals here that stopped to provide some food and clothing. In the evening dinner was served by local activists.

In addition about 400 are housed. <br>The whole camp is currently being moved backwards to be 100 meters from the road. Local authorities have threatened the demolishment.<br>There have been police attacks to the Kurdish section where there are many women and kids. The aim is to reduce the area of the camp by kicking out 1000 people and sending them to other camps all over France. Random fires, fights, police violence and lack of support became a daily routine for the refugees staying in the “jungle”. <br><br>There is a right wing group (French nationals) operating and they are armed with knives in Rue Des Gravelines .

						<value>There have been new containers built which have heating but no running water and no toilets. In addition about 400 are housed. 
The whole camp is currently being moved backwards to be 100 meters from the road. Local authorities have threatened the demolishment.
There have been police attacks to the Kurdish section where there are many women and kids. The aim is to reduce the area of the camp by kicking out 1000 people and sending them to other camps all over France. Random fires, fights, police violence and lack of support became a daily routine for the refugees staying in the “jungle”. 

There is a right wing group (French nationals) operating and they are armed with knives in Rue Des Gravelines . They have intimidated and threatened activists and volunteers and on 18/12 night have grown in size and are just goading for trouble. Police keeps on using teargases on refugees.

A lot of people from Calais camp have come to live in Dunkirk who are moving out because of the riots with police.

Since mid-October the gvt offered refugees to go to various places throughout France to get a rest and ask for asylum. 1000 accepted it but their paperwork is not ready yet and associations are worried that this move was very poorly organized and will not facilitate refugees. In addition, Police has been arresting about 50 people/day to send them to detention centers throughout France. 99% of them are released after days.

Due to strict security measures refugees are not allowed to leave the camp. 

The gvt provides 2500 meals daily.

Bujanovac is a transit point. The “camp” here is in some sort old state-owned facility. It is where some refugees currently come from Presevo due to having better transport connections – bus and train. Some choose to take buses to Sid from here, as the bus drivers are apparently “less” predatory than in Presevo. It has been designed as an “overflow” registration point and also has the potential to be an accommodation facility.

Improvements are taking place, as the running water. Now, drinkable tap water can be provided to refugees. It will reduce plastic bottle waste, offer better facilities for personal hygiene, and make cooking and cleaning in the camp a lot easier. There is also a  medical clinic set up last week and new sleeping tents.

Volunteers are creating more space for both clothing and sleeping.

There is very little support from large aid agencies here—it is almost all small-scale groups and individual volunteers helping people off boats and attending to their immediate needs: medical care, dry clothes, etc.

The place is controlled and run by Lighthouse. It's a small camp to be used for emergent hosting of refugees if there is no place in Mantamados shelter and UNHCR transit camp.  It has a 120 people capacity. 
It provides food, clothes, medical care and sleeping tents for late arrivals. 

From here, there are mini vans that bring people to the transit camp run by UNHCR in Sikaminea.

The number of boats here vary day to day. Most boats arrive during the night. Many refugees suffering from hypothermia, 

Child trafficking operated by criminal organizations upon arrival from the sea.

In addition to the humanitarian catastrophe, volunteers are now confronted with an ecological disaster. Tons of waste litter the coasts, and little creeks which are accessible only by sea. In co-operation with the town council and fishermen of Skala Sykamineas, volunteers are involved in a huge cleaning action of the coast.

Skala Sikamineas has been reported as the major landing spot for boats at this moment. In Skala Sikamineas village live 300 locals in summer and 50 in winter. It has been receiving refugees on the shores since years and with an outbreak since April 2015.

						<value>Kirkenes is a Norwegian town 9 miles from the Russian border. It has a population of 3,498 (2013). Refugee shelters can be found here. Refugees can get here temporary refugee status.

Syrians, Afghans, Egyptians, Tunisians, Palestinians, Iraqis and Iranians are trying the Arctic route because they see it as safer and cheaper alternative to leaky boats on the Mediterranean and they can get Russian visas as a transit path to Norway.

Refugees fly from Moscow to Murmansk. From Murmansk, they take taxi to the Russian town of Nickel, 166 miles away, by passing through barren tundra, Russian military bases and heavily armed checkpoints.

Here, they pack into the only hotel with other refugees for a night and/or they seek refuge in a nearby student dormitory.

Vans loaded with bicycles organized by Russian smugglers wait outside of the hotel to send them closer to the Russian-Norwegian border on the morning after. It is 25 miles to the border. They then bike to cross the border into Norway, the only transportation mean allowed. One bike is sold for 200 $. Lift cars are not allowed and people who're going to do it will be fined. 

Kirkenes's Mayor announced that hospitality will be guaranteed at least to Syrians.

				<description><![CDATA[Updated at: 17/1 18:30 10:00 CET<br>Nr. of refugees: 500-1000 twice a week<br><br>Situation: One ferry is due to arrive at 20-20:30.<br><br>Despite the fact that refugees are not allowed, currently, to pass through the border with FYROM, people continue to come to Kavala as normal in the hope to go to the border.<br><br>Refugees do not stay here at the present time. They generally move by bus to Idomeni. Few people sometimes may sleep over in a hotel (if they can afford it) or 'Kavala collaboration movement for the support of the Syrian refugees' tries to accommodate them in buildings or houses provided by volunteers. Sometimes people have slept out. <br><br>The movement present here and other independent volunteers also provide food, clothes and other essentials directly to refugees upon their arrival.

						<value>One ferry is due to arrive at 20-20:30.

Despite the fact that refugees are not allowed, currently, to pass through the border with FYROM, people continue to come to Kavala as normal in the hope to go to the border.

Refugees do not stay here at the present time. They generally move by bus to Idomeni. Few people sometimes may sleep over in a hotel (if they can afford it) or 'Kavala collaboration movement for the support of the Syrian refugees' tries to accommodate them in buildings or houses provided by volunteers. Sometimes people have slept out. 

The movement present here and other independent volunteers also provide food, clothes and other essentials directly to refugees upon their arrival. People from nearby cities have also joined them and they're helping out.

There are 2 ships that arrive in Kavala weekly from Lesvos (Mitilini). They usually stop at the island of Limnos and may pick up more refugees. The ships come every Wednesday and Saturday at around 19:00.

						<value>There are still problems with aid donations coming to camp during weekend: donations which are not needed.  There are 3 distribution points where supplies are accepted:
1) tents, blankets and sleeping bags only
2) men clothes only
3) women and children clothes only
At the new arrival center, food donations are accepted. Please contact Rastplatz first.

ALL AID DONATIONS SHOULD BE SORTED AND LABELED, and if possible, put in plastic storage containers with lids, because the tents are leaking.

ABC is suggesting to approach the site with vehicles full of one kind of aid (i.e. blankets only) as the supply distribution is getting difficult.

ABC has set up a system whereby they can send lists of supply needs to l'Auberge des Migrants in Calais and Calais can provide spare volunteers to Dunkirk when needed.

Anyone planning to drop goods, contact organisations beforehand. Alternatively you can take taking them to Calais warehouse where they will be stored for Dunkirk until needed.

Volunteers needed during weekdays, especially after 18:00.

The women and children's distribution tent is in desperate need of sorting donations and repairing the roof because the tent is leaking.

There is a meeting at 10.15 in the main white tent in the camp each morning. Here volunteers can get a briefing and get given jobs for the day. ABC suggests to volunteers to bring waterproof gloves for picking up rubbish and loads of bin liners. If they can they can take home items like saucepans, blankets etc that have dropped in the mud, wash them and bring them back to the distribution tents.

MSF is looking for set up new projects. Volunteers and NGOs can get in touch with its coordinator. 

Aid Box Convoy – Bristol to Refugees in Europe volunteers onsite daily till 18:00. New volunteers need to pay for their own accommodation.
Contact: www.aidboxconvoy.co.uk

Rastplatz is providing 1000 meals a day and coordinating the distribution tent for men's clothes and the "new arrivals center".

Zebrapad.eu visits Dunkirk 2 to 3 times a week with 6 to 12 volunteers.

Solidarityforall.org only visits occasionally, when they have big loads of aid supplies.

School students have been involved in preparing food for refugees here.

There is very little support from large aid agencies here—it is almost all small-scale groups and individual volunteers helping people off boats and attending to their immediate needs: medical care, dry clothes, etc.

APHRODITE Hotel is paying refugees' buses heading to the shelters 40 Km away, besides feeding them.

Drapen i havet, Help the refugees in Molyvos, Starfish Foundation, Disaster Medics, Boat Refugee Foundation and Team Humanity onsite.

Molyvos has been reported as landing spot. 
From here refugees wait for a minivan to Oasis (bus stop) that will take them to Oxy and from there they take a bus to Mitilini camps or they walk. If they opt for walking, they need to walk to Mitilini for 65-70 km. The journey will take 16-20 hours along a highway with sharp turns and many hills.Along the road for the first 23 km there are water taps where they can access free drinkable water. They can't take a taxi. Without registering, according to the government they have illegally entered Greece.. It is also illegal for private cars to drive them. If they do so they need to inform the police otherwise they can be arrested.

Refugees can get shelter, food and water in Kalloni that is in between.

Local organisations, NGOs such as the IRC, MSF, Save the Children, Mercy Corps and the UN are operating free bus services to Mytilene, stopping at the registration camps. Once arriving in Molyvos, refugees will be directed to a location where they can find the bus service.

						<value>On site volunteers are waiting for knowing from the local administration on the new location.

Following the clearing on December 6th due to administrative reasons where Amici del Baobab was providing useful services (food, shelter, arrival kit, information, medical care, winter clothes) in two buildings, the organization keeps on doing what possible to help people out by providing legal and medical services directly on the street, information to find charity centers, canteens and place to sleep provided by NGOs and Rome Department for Social Affairs.

Members of the Operative Office of the Department can be found in Cupa road (wearing yellow jackets). Their task is to manage the number of available beds in Rome and look for accommodations by calling the centers. That could be a long operation. They ask people their name, surname and date of birth when they found a bed for them in City Council-run centers. They don’t make any identification when beds are found in the Red Cross center. RC center primarily hosts women and vulnerable, old, sick and disable people. Also City council run centers following these criteria but there have been exceptions.Therefore it could be very difficult for a healthy male person getting a place to sleep.

Unaccompanied minors are hosted in the non governative InterSOS dormitory in 26A Aniene road . They cannot be accompanied by the Department employees because Italian legislation requires identification by Police. Therefore a civil servant cannot ignore their transit. For that reason Baobab volunteers drive them to the center from which they can easily get by bus via Cupa road and Tiburtina Station. No identification is required. Save the Children volunteers whenever possible show them how to get to the “Civico Zero” open center in dei Bruzi road, easily reachable by bus from Cupa road.

There are very few beds available for refugees in transit. Their transit in Rome is well known to the authorities and thanks to the meeting with Baobab volunteers the City Council informally approved the utilization of centers opened for homeless in winter also for migrants, in order to add more temporary accommodations. Not all of this centers are open in daylight hours. A canteen is missing in the same structure. Another problem is the possibility to easily get to the bus and the railway stations to continue their journey. 

The only building with the specific task of hosting refugees is the Italian Red Cross center in 44 A del Frantoio road, close to the B “Santa Maria del Soccorso” underground stop. The capacity of the facility is 50/60 beds.

Whenever possible, Baobab volounteers bring there refugees. This facility is sometimes provided by RC or the City Council workers. City council and RC don’t make public any news about the duration of this structure which was privately owned and seized by Rome Court and temporaly given to RC.

Baobab volounteers are very worried about the emergency scenario that a 30 people arrival could cause. In winter the refugees’ number in transit drastically reduced in Rome because of the sea weather condition, the most stingent application of Dublin procedures in the south of Italy and the news on the Baobab centre closure. Spring situation is difficult to figure out.

People getting here are Eritrean, Afghani, Sudanese (mainly) Ethiopian, Syrian, Palestinian and from other countries of Western Sub-Saharan Africa.

Officially, next destination for people getting here is the RC center.
